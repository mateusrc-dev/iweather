This application consists of being able to monitor data about the climate of a region.

This application consumes an API 'OpenWeather' that returns climate data for a given region

Some techniques used to create the application:

- StyleSheet -> to create component stylizations
- Context -> to share information with the entire application
- Dayjs -> to handle dates
- asyncStorage -> to store data on the user's device

The testing-library lib was also used to test the rendering of components

To use the application on your machine:

- Simply download the repository and run the 'npm run start' command in the terminal within the repository
- Use an android emulator, I recommend Android Studio
